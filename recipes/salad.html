        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Embark on a journey of freshness and vibrant flavors with this delightful Strawberry Salad featuring a
            tantalizing Poppy Seed Dressing. Begin by assembling a symphony of crisp mixed greens, including baby
            spinach and arugula, providing a perfect canvas for the star of the show: succulent, ruby-red strawberries.
            These sweet jewels, sliced to perfection, infuse the salad with a burst of natural sweetness, complementing
            the earthy greens. To elevate the ensemble, add a crunch with candied pecans and a creamy note with crumbled
            feta cheese, creating a harmonious blend of textures that dance on the palate.</p>

        <p>The pièce de résistance of this salad is undoubtedly the Poppy Seed Dressing. A luscious concoction of olive
            oil, balsamic vinegar, honey, and, of course, poppy seeds, this dressing weaves a tapestry of flavors that
            ties the salad together. Its slightly sweet and tangy profile drapes the ingredients with a light,
            refreshing embrace. This Strawberry Salad with Poppy Seed Dressing is not merely a dish; it's a celebration
            of seasonal freshness and culinary artistry, inviting you to relish each bite and savor the essence of
            summer on your plate.</p>
