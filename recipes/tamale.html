       <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I learned to make homemade tamales many years ago from a sweet elderly woman in Puebla, Mexico. My husband
            and I were living in Puebla for a few months and became friends with this woman and her family. Her daughter
            was the secretary at the office building where we worked.</p>

        <p> This sweet grandmother made incredible tamales! I expressed my desire to learn the ins and outs of authentic
            Mexican cooking, so the Grandma invited me over for a “tamalada” or Tamale making party. She made her masa
            dough completely from scratch, using dried white corn kernels and “cal” , which has been difficult for me to
            find in the U.S..</p>
